# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Traditional_ML
The repository contains two projects in which the exploratory data analysis of two different datasets are carried out.


## PROJECT 1 -

1.	Carried out a complete exploratory data analysis on App Store Games to analyze important trends in the data to show the best combination of strategy games based on the user rating which was 4 or above.
2.	The process of analysis involved cleaning the data to remove unnecessary data points, plotting graphs to determine the relationships between different parameters.
3.	The project involved the use of analysis and data processing libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## PROJECT 2 â€“ 

1.	Carried out Exploratory data analysis on a Cars Dataset for price prediction.
2.	The process of analysis involved cleaning the data to remove unnecessary data points, plotting graphs to determine the relationships between different parameters.
3.	Used SKLearn to predict the Price of the test cars based on the parameters using Random Forest Regressor Algorithm with R-Squared score for accuracy evaluation.
